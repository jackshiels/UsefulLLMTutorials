        "# Encoder-Decoder Models\n",
        "\n",
        "The following tutorial explores basic encoder-decoder models and walks through building one for machine translation. For more foundational understanding, see Chapter 2 of *Large Language Models: A Deep Dive*. You can find it for under $15 here: [purchase](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-65647-7)\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Encoder-Decoder Models Work\n",
        "\n",
        "Encoder-decoder models are designed to handle **variable-length inputs and outputs**, a challenge in many natural language processing tasks. Unlike standard neural networks with fixed input/output sizes (e.g., classifiers), encoder-decoder models dynamically generate sequences of arbitrary length by learning token-by-token outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **encoder** transforms an input sequence into a fixed-size (or variable-length) vector representation, called a **context vector**. During training, the model learns to encode meaningful features of the input sequence into this representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **decoder** takes the context vector and generates the output sequence, one token at a time, typically using **autoregression** (feeding its previous output back in as input). This process relies on a hidden state that evolves as more tokens are generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "The architecture involves two sets of hidden states:\n",
        "- One in the encoder, which processes the input tokens.\n",
        "- One in the decoder, which generates output tokens based on both the encoder's context and previously generated tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "The predictive capability of the decoder comes from probabilistically selecting the next token, based on the formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\text{softmax}(s_{t-1}, y'_{t-1}, c)$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- $\\text s_{t-1}$ is the decoder's previous hidden state  \n",
        "- $\\text y'_{t-1}$ is the previously generated token  \n",
        "- $\\text c$ is the context vector from the encoder\n",
        "\n",
        "**Softmax** transforms a vector of logits (raw model scores) into probabilities that sum to 1, enabling the model to sample or choose the most likely next token.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What this Means / TL:DR\n",
        "\n",
        "TL:DR you can train a model to learn sequence probabilities such that it can output sequences that vary in length. Here are few examples of what you could do with such a network:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Translate one language to another (a very common. use case)\n",
        "- Extract data from a sentence, such as highlighting named entities (e.g., names, nouns, locations)\n",
        "- Predict time series data\n",
        "\n",
        "The crux of an ancoder decoder model is: we have a sequence, can we predict another sequence that depends on the data in this sequence?\n",
        "\n",
        "### What this Tutorial Does\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial we'll be building an English to French translator model. We'll use a very small toy dataset, so don't expect accuracy. Remember to write it out yourself, line by line. We'll start by grabbing the data from hugging face. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS FUNCTION, just focus on the fact that we have some training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Good luck!"

        "# Tokenizer\n",
        "\n",
        "What is a tokenizer? Tokenizers determine how to transform your input data into vector-ready data for the machine learning process. One way to tokenize a sentence is to simply assign unique numbers to each individual word. You could do this by counting up from 1 every time you encounter a new word and storing these values in a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other, more complex and performant tokenizers exist. Some tokenizers will often reduce words into their 'lemmas' (base words) or 'stems' (base strings) to avoid producing overly large vocabularies. However, these tokenizer are becoming less common as models become larger.\n",
        "\n",
        "We build a simple tokenizer to introduce the concept. This tokenizer does not reduce to lemmas or stems on inputs. Instead, each unique word is given a numeric representation that counts upward as new words are added. This tokenizer will also be used to decode the model output back into french.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Token Types\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note *how* we deal with variable length sequences in this model. We already described how encoder-decoder models can handle variable length outputs, making them excellent for translation. However, we still need strategies around how to signal the start and end of a sentence, and how we ultimately fit these variable length sequences into the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can do this with four tokens. These tokens are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- PAD: the $\\text <pad>$ token is added N times to the end of a sequence to prevent a sequence from being too short.\n",
        "- SOS: the Start of Sentence $\\text <sos>$ token signals a sequence has started.\n",
        "- EOS: the End of Sentence $\\text <eos>$ token signals a sequence has ended.\n",
        "-UNK: the unknown $\\text <unk>$ token is used for inputs that the tokenizer does not have in its vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since our model ultimately has a maximum sequence length, we adjust the tokenizer to support a padding token, which we'll add to training data later on. For now, our tokenizer should support these four unique tokens, alongside all the token values for our training dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### TL:DR\n",
        "\n",
        "The tokenizer converts words to numbers, and we have some special tokens to handle padding (ensuring all inputs are the same length), start and ends of sentences (so that when we decode, we know when to stop), and an unknown token for any out-of-vocabulary inputs that are provided to our model."

You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit\n",

However, we can improve the accuracy of the model by implementing attention. Attention in this instance is the measure of how well the encoder output matches the decoder hidden state. The results from this measure are then added to the context vector from the encoder to feed into the decoder module. More information is provided below.\n",

        "\n",
        "The reset gate is similarly shaped, and is essentially the same computation (just applied differently to the candidate hidden state).\n",
        "\n",
        "The candidate hidden state applies both of the previous gates in the identity tanh(). Some of the new data is kept, and some of it is forgotten. This helps to minimise issues where irrelevant past learned information is retained into the final hidden state.\n",
